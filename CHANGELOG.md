## v0.2.0 (2024/10/04)

## Breaking Change

Unfortunately, from version **0.2.0**, I've made some breaking changes in the code to help move forward with the project. 
So, what does this mean for you, the end user.
1) You'll need to remove all previously discovered devices from HomeKit before adding them back in after upgrading to this version
2) If using Homebridge version, remove any cached acccesory data associated with this plug-in
3) If using docker/standalone version, remove the 'persist' folder
4) Re-add devices to HomeKit once version upgraded
5) Any HomeKit Secure Video recordings will be lost
6) Will need to re-configure camera streaming and notification options
6) Any automations will need to be re-created in HomeKit
7) History in EveHome app will be lost

Apologies for this change, as I can understand what an inconvience and frustration it will be :-(
