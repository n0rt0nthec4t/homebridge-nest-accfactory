# Homebridge Nest Accfcatory

</span>

This is a HAP-NodeJS accessory I have developed to allow Nest devices to be used with HomeKit including having support for HomeKit Secure Video on doorbells and camera devices

**HomeKit Secure Video Support is disabled by default and needs to be explicitly enabled by the user**

## Supported Devices

The following Nest devices are supported

* Nest Thermostats (Gen 1, Gen 2, Gen 3, E)
* Nest Protects (Gen 1, Gen 2)
* Nest Temp Sensors
* Nest Cameras (Cam Indoor, IQ Indoor, Outdoor, IQ Outdoor)
* Nest Hello (Wired Gen 1)

The accessory supports connection to Nest using a Nest account OR a Google (migrated Nest account) account.
